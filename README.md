# Machine Learning Repository

This repository hosts a collection of machine learning projects implemented in PyTorch, covering object detection, classification, and more.

## Object Detection

The object detection projects in this repository are inspired by the work of Aladdin Persson. You can find the original source code in the following GitHub repository:

- Repository: [Machine-Learning-Collection](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/object_detection)
- Author: Aladdin Persson

We have adapted the object detection implementations from this repository as a foundation for our projects.

## Additional Information

This repository presents a variation of the YOLOv1 model where instead of height and width in bounding boxes, radius is used. All functions are based on detecting circles instead of rectangles. Additionally, a model has been trained for detecting apples, achieving a final mAP (mean Average Precision) of 25% over the range from 0.5 to 0.95.

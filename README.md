# Machine Learning Collection

This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects implemented in PyTorch, including object detection, classification, and more.

## Object Detection

The object detection projects in this repository are based on the work of Aladdin Persson. The original source code can be found in the following GitHub repository:

- Repository: [Machine-Learning-Collection](https://github.com/aladdinpersson/Machine-Learning-Collection/tree/master/ML/Pytorch/object_detection)
- Author: Aladdin Persson

I have utilized the object detection implementations from this repository as a reference for my own projects. All credit for the object detection implementations goes to Aladdin Persson.
